# Smoothing-Temperature-Data

This repository is based on my final project for the Fall '23 Computational Statistics course I took at Johns Hopkins for my MS. The project applies smoothing techniques to temperature time series. I propose using the *super-smoother with k-block cross-validation* to overcome some of the significant difficulties that temperature data pose for automated smoothing techniques.
