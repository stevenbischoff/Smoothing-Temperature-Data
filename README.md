# Smoothing-Temperature-Data

This project applies smoothing techniques to temperature time series. I propose using a *super-smoother with k-block cross-validation* to overcome some of the significant difficulties that temperature data pose for other automated smoothing techniques.

This repository contains a short paper outlining how I arrived at the technique (Smoothing-Temperature-Data.pdf), the temperature data used, and a .rmd file with R code.

Adapted from my final project for the Fall '23 Computational Statistics course I took at Johns Hopkins for my MS.
