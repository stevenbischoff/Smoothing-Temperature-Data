# Smoothing-Temperature-Data

Adapted from my final project for the Fall '23 Computational Statistics course I took at Johns Hopkins for my MS. The project applies smoothing techniques to temperature time series. I propose using the *super-smoother with k-block cross-validation* to overcome some of the significant difficulties that temperature data pose for automated smoothing techniques.

This repository contains a short paper outlining how I arrived at the technique, the temperature data used, and a .rmd file with R code.
